# Deployment Fixes Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to fix the module import issues with React Icons and React Router DOM.

## Issues Fixed

1. Missing module files:
   - react-icons/fa/index.mjs
   - react-icons/si/index.mjs
   - react-router-dom/dist/index.mjs

## Fix Strategy

1. Created a central icon exports utility:
   - Created `src/utils/iconExports.js` that centralizes all icon and router imports
   - Updated all components to use this utility instead of direct imports

2. Added module resolution helpers:
   - Created symlinks in `src/node_modules` for problematic dependencies
   - Updated build scripts to create these symlinks during deployment

3. Enhanced Webpack configuration:
   - Added `craco.config.js` with enhanced module resolution settings
   - Created module aliases to help the bundler find dependencies

4. Updated dependency versions:
   - Downgraded react-icons to 4.11.0 (from 4.12.0)
   - Downgraded react-router-dom to 6.18.0 (from 6.19.0)

5. Enhanced build process:
   - Updated build scripts with proper flags and environment variables
   - Added NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider to handle older Node APIs
   - Improved error handling in build scripts

## Deployment Configuration

1. Vercel configuration updated:
   - Added custom build commands in vercel.json
   - Set proper environment variables for build process
   - Added SPA routing configuration

## Testing

The build process now completes successfully and creates a production-ready bundle.

## Next Steps

Deploy to Vercel using one of these methods:
1. Git push to trigger automatic deployment
2. Run `vercel --prod` from the command line
3. Upload the build folder manually through the Vercel dashboard
